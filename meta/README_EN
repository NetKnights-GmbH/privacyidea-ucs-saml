privacyIDEA RADIUS is a module that can be used to authenticate at RADIUS based systems like
a firewall or SSL VPN with a second factor. This second factor is managed by a privacyIDEA server that
is installed somewhere in your network.
</p>
<p>
You can configure privacyIDEA RADIUS using UCR variables:
<ul>
<li><b>privacyidea/radius/url</b> The URL of the privacyIDEA server. If there is only one privacyIDEA server
in your network, this variable will be set automatically.
</li>
<li><b>privacyidea/radius/enable</b> Set to "1" to enable OTP authentication.
The default RADIUS configuration (in sites-enabled) will be deactivated.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Please note: You also need to create client machine definitions accordingly in the file /etc/freeradius/clients.conf.
